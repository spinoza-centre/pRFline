This repository contains the code for the manuscript entitled: "A selection and targeting framework of cortical locations for line-scanning fMRI". We present a selection and targeting framework of cortical locations for ultrahigh spatio-temporal resolution line-scanning fMRI. This approach bridges canonical fMRI experiments with electrophysiological experiments and allows novel avenues for studying human physiology non-invasively.
